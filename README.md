# Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine is an engaging project designed for musicians and music producers to generate random MIDI notes within a selected key signature. This tool is excellent for stimulating creativity and coming up with unique melodies and chord progressions.

## How It Works

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine generates random MIDI notes based on the selected key signature. It's a versatile tool for creating distinctive melodies and enhancing your music production journey with spontaneous inspiration.

## Dependencies

To ensure smooth operation with REAPER on Windows 10, you'll need:

1. **MIDIberry**: A MIDI loopback driver to route MIDI data between applications on your computer. [Download MIDIberry](https://www.manyetas.com/creed/midiberry).
2. **loopMIDI**: A tool for creating virtual MIDI ports on Windows, facilitating communication between different MIDI software applications. [Download loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).

## Compatibility

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine is confirmed to work well with:

- **REAPER on Windows 10**: Tested extensively for reliability and performance.
- **MIDI+BTLE and BandLab on Android**: Newly compatible, expanding its usability for mobile musicians and producers.

While primarily designed for Windows 10, you may find success using it with other Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and operating systems. Experiment with your setup and share your experiences!

## Installation

1. **MIDIberry and loopMIDI**: Download and install both applications following the instructions on their respective websites.
