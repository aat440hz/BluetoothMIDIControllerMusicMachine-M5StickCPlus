# Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine is a fun project that allows you to generate random MIDI notes within a selected key signature. This project is especially useful for musicians and music producers looking for creative inspiration.

## How It Works

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine generates random MIDI notes within a selected key signature. You can use it to come up with unique melodies and chord progressions. It's a great tool for sparking creativity in your music production process.

## Dependencies

To use the Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine, you'll need two pieces of software for it to work seamlessly with REAPER on Windows 10:

1. **MIDIberry**: MIDIberry is a MIDI loopback driver that allows you to route MIDI data between applications on your computer. You can download it [here](https://www.manyetas.com/creed/midiberry).

2. **loopMIDI**: loopMIDI is another essential tool for creating virtual MIDI ports on your Windows computer. It enables communication between different software applications that use MIDI. You can download it [here](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).

## Compatibility

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Machine has been tested and works great with REAPER. While it's specifically designed for Windows 10, it may work with other Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) as well. Feel free to try it with your preferred DAW or operating system and share your experiences.
